Power Pivot and Dax syntax used in ChocolateSales project:
Total Amount = SUM(sales[Amount]) 
Total Boxes = SUM(sales[Boxes])
Shipment count = COUNTROWS(sales) 
Amount per shipment = DIVIDE([Total Amount],[Shipment count], "No shipment")
APS achive target = IF([Amount per shipment]> 4500, "Yes","No")
product count = COUNTROWS(products)
Low box shipment count = CALCULATE([Shipment count], sales[Boxes]<50)  
LBS% = DIVIDE([Low box shipment count],[Shipment count])*100 
Bar% = DIVIDE(CALCULATE([Shipment count], products[Category]="Bars"),[Shipment count])*100 
Bites% = DIVIDE(CALCULATE([Shipment count], products[Category]="Bites"),[Shipment count])*100 

**newcolumn** weekday = WEEKDAY(sales[SaleDate])
Total amount Friday = CALCULATE([Total Amount], sales[weekday]=6) 

total amount APAC = (
     var nu=CALCULATE([Total Amount], geo[Geo]="New Zealand")
     var ast=CALCULATE([Total Amount], geo[Geo]="Australia")
     var ind=CALCULATE([Total Amount], geo[Geo]="India")
     return nu+ast+ind)

total amount APAC 2 = (CALCULATE([Total Amount], geo[Geo] in {"New Zealand","Australia","India"}))
